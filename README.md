# Bill Manager

## Overview

This project is a web application and API built in Go (Golang) for managing bills by parsing QR codes from Serbian bills. It allows users to easily scan their bills, extract relevant information, and manage their expenses efficiently.

This is a refactor of the python version of the project. The original project can be found here: [billdb flask server](https://github.com/lumpsoid/billdb_flask_api), and [billdb package](https://github.com/lumpsoid/billdb).

## Features
- Bill information parsing: The application can extract information from QR codes found on Serbian bills.
- Bill management: Users can view, organize, and categorize their bills.
- Expense tracking: Users can track their expenses over time.
- API endpoints: Provides API endpoints for integrating with other applications or services.
